# Mini-project: Library Management System

## Introduction of the Program:

Welcome to my mini project for Coding Temple! This project is based on making a Contact management system.
This project will assist you in managing all your contacts in a list and also write it to a file and import the file back
to the system.

## Installation of the Program:

To install the program make sure you download the .py file and run it in your compiler to execute the program.

## How to use the program:

**Step 1:**
A menu will pop up that will guide you through the program. Press 1, 2 or 3 to access the different options in the library system .

**Step 2:**
If option 1 was selected you will enter the process of adding a new book, borrowing a book, return a book or search for a book in our system. You can also see a list of all the books you have added or been added to our system.

**Step 3:**
If option 2 is selected, you will have the option of adding in your user information which will include your name, library id and birthdate. You can then view information on the users and a list of all the current users added to the system

**Step 4:**
If option 3 is selected, you can add authors and a small biography on them into our system. You then can like option 2 view and display all the authors in our library!

**Step 5:**
All menus have an option to go back to the main menu if selected.
